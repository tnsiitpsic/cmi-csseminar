									<h4>Abstract</h4> <p>
										In this talk, I will present new results on envy-free allocations of indivisible goods among agents with shared valuations. EFX, or envy-freeness up to any good, is a compelling relaxation of envy-freeness, previously known to exist in specific cases - most notably, for three agents [Chaudhury et al., EC 2020], and for any number of agents with just two valuations [Mahara, Discret. Appl. Math 2023]. Our work expands these boundaries, showing that EFX allocations exist for any number of agents with up to three types of agents with additive valuations.</p>

										<b>Title:</b> Addressing Bias in Algorithmic Solutions: Exploring Vertex Cover and Feedback Vertex Set</br>
										<a href="resources/shakil-slides.pdf">Slides</a> | <a href="">Reference Papers</a> | <a href="https://youtu.be/tUb6qHvKBvs">Link to the Talk</a> | <a href="#">Speaker Info</a>

									<h4>Abstract</h4> <p>
										A typical goal of research in combinatorial optimization is to come up with fast algorithms that find optimal solutions to a computational problem. The process that takes a real-world problem and extracts a clean mathematical abstraction of it often throws out a lot of “side information” which is deemed irrelevant. However, the discarded information could be of real significance to the end-user of the algorithm's output. All solutions of the same cost are not necessarily of equal impact in the real-world; some solutions may be much more desirable than others, even at the expense of additional increase in cost. If the impact, positive or negative, is mostly felt by some specific (minority) subgroups of the population, the population at large will be largely unaware of it. </p></br>
										<p>In this work we ask the question of finding solutions to combinatorial optimization problems that are “unbiased” with respect to a collection of specified subgroups of the total population. We consider a simple model of bias, and study it via two basic optimization problems on graphs: Vertex Cover and Feedback Vertex Set, which are both NP-hard. Here, the input is a graph and the solution is a subset of the vertex set. The vertices represent members of a population, and each vertex has been assigned a subset of colors, where each color indicates membership of a specific subgroup. The goal is to find a small-sized solution to the optimization problem in which no color appears more than a specified—per-color—number of times. The colors can be used to model various relevant—economic, political, demographic, or other—classes to which the entities belong, and the variants that we study can then be used to look for small solutions which enforce per-class upper bounds on the number of removed entities. These upper-bounds enforce the constraint that no subclass of the population is over-represented in the solution. We show the new variants of Vertex Cover and Feedback Vertex Set, obtained by adding these additional constraints, are Fixed-Parameter Tractable, when parameterized by various combinations of the solution size, the number of colors, and the treewidth of the graph. Our results shows that it is possible to devise fast algorithms to solve these problem in many practical settings.</p></br>

										<b>Title:</b> Deciding reachability and coverability in Lossy EOS(continued)</br>

									<h4>Abstract</h4> <p>Last time, we familiarised ourselves with Petri Nets, and we extended the syntax and semantics to EOSs -- a higher-order Petri Net fragment restricted to two levels of nesting. We plan to briefly revisit EOSs and mostly spend time looking at the decidability and undecidability results on the reachability and coverability problems for EOSs and a syntactic restriction of EOSs called conservative EOSs.

									</div>
									<h4>Abstract</h4> <p>Elementary Object Systems (EOSs) are a representative of the nets-within-nets paradigm, where the places of a system Petri Net (PN) can also host object nets in place of standard black tokens. Recently, EOSs were put forward to naturally capture the notion of break-downs, under the let-it-crash approach, even when lacking any extra domain knowledge: break-downs can affect only the computational units modeled by object nets. The break-downs are represented by removing all tokens from the internal markings of the object nets, so as to enforce a deadlock. In this setting, one can check whether a property is robust, i.e., if it holds even in front of at most a given number of break-downs (possibly infinitely many). The approach of induced deadlocks is reminiscent of lossy Petri Nets, where some token (perhaps all) may be non-deterministically lost. The partial loss of a marking can be seen as a more fine-grained variant of break-down, where the EOS components partially degrade. We are interested in the decidability of reachability/coverability problems for such EOSs with lossy steps. </p></br>
									<p>In this talk, we will start by defining Petri Nets, and extend its syntax and semantics to EOSs. Then, we will describe the results from our PNSE 24 paper (joint work with Francesco Di Cosmo, Free University of Bolzano, and Tephilla Prince, IIT Dharwad), where, we fully charted the decidability of reachability and coverability problems in front of various forms of lossiness: only at the object net level, only at the system net level, or at both. We do that for both EOSs and a fragment of EOS called conservative EOSs. Our results show that almost all the studied problems are undecidable. The only decidable cases regard conservative EOSs in front of any given positive number of losses and EOSs in front of arbitrarily many losses, both at the system and object net level. The latter result is especially interesting since finitely many losses still result in undecidability.

									<h4>Abstract</h4> <p>Given an infinite sequence of natural numbers, we may ask the following questions:</br>
										How many arithmetic operations are needed to compute the n-th term of the sequence?</br>
									   Can the sequence be captured by some simple model of computation such as finite automata?</br>
									   How to tell if the formal power series associated with the sequence is rational, algebraic or transcendental function? </br>
									   I will present a survey of some of the known results related to these questions. </p>

										<b>Title:</b> Recognizing Numbers</br>

									</div>
									<h4>Abstract</h4> 
									<p>In this talk we will recognize numbers, but perhaps not in the way you might guess. The algebraic notion of recognizability has been quite fruitful in the study of regular word languages. In this work, we look at the same idea of “recognizability by finite monoids” for other monoids. In particular, we attempt to characterize the recognizable subsets of various additive and multiplicative monoids over integers, rationals, reals, and complex numbers. While these recognizable sets satisfy properties such as closure under Boolean operations and inverse morphisms, they do not enjoy many of the nice properties that recognizable word languages do.</p></br>

										<b>Title:</b> Revisiting Tree Canonization using polynomials</br>

									<h4>Abstract</h4> 
									<p>Graph Isomorphism (GI) is a fundamental algorithmic problem. Amongst graph classes for which the computational complexity of GI has been resolved, trees are arguably the most fundamental. Tree Isomorphism is complete for deterministic logspace, a tiny subclass of polynomial time, by Lindell's result. Over three decades ago, he devised a deterministic logspace algorithm that computes a string which is a canon for the input tree -- two trees are isomorphic precisely when their canons are identical. </p></br>

									<p>Inspired by Miller-Reif's reduction of Tree Isomorphism to Polynomial Identity Testing, we present a new logspace algorithm for tree canonization fundamentally different from Lindell's algorithm. Our algorithm computes a univariate polynomial as canon for an input tree, based on the classical Eisenstein's criterion for the irreducibility of univariate polynomials. This can be implemented in logspace by invoking the well known Buss et al. algorithm for arithmetic formula evaluation. </p></br>
										
									<p>This algorithm is conceptually very simple, avoiding the delicate case analysis and complex recursion that constitute the core of Lindell's algorithm. We will also see the adaptability of our algorithm by extending it to a couple of other classes of graphs.</p></br>

											<b>Title:</b> Existential Second-Order Logic Over Strings</br>
											<a href="#">Slides</a> | <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/331605.331609">Reference Paper</a> | <a href="https://youtu.be/YZOrsSeFuAA">Link to the Talk</a> | <a href="#">Speaker Info</a>
										</div>
										<h4>Abstract</h4> <p>Second-order logic over finite structures has attracted the interest of logicians, mathematicians, and computer scientists for a long time. In 1960, Büchi proved that monadic second-order logic (MSO) over strings precisely expresses the class of regular languages. In 1974, Fagin provided a purely logical characterization of the class NP in terms of second-order logic, demonstrating that, over finite structures, the properties decidable in NP are precisely those definable in existential second-order logic (ESO). These results imply that, over strings, ESO is much more expressive than MSO. But how do syntactic fragments of ESO compare with MSO?</p></br>

										<p>Prefix classes are among the most natural and commonly studied syntactic fragments of any predicate logic. Eiter, Gottlob, and Gurevich present an interesting dichotomy result: an ESO-prefix class over strings either expresses only regular languages (and is thus in MSO) or expresses some NP-complete language. Furthermore, they show that the satisfiability problem for an ESO-prefix class over strings is decidable if and only if it is in MSO.</p></br>
											
										<p>In the first half of this talk, we will precisely state Fagin's theorem and motivate its proof. In the second half, we will examine the aforementioned dichotomy results.</p></br>
											
										<p>This talk is primarily based on the paper "Existential Second-Order Logic Over Strings" by Thomas Eiter, Georg Gottlob, and Yuri Gurevich.</p></br>

												<b>Title: </b>A Myhill-Nerode style characterization for timed automata with integer resets </br>

											</div>
											<h4>Abstract</h4> <p>The well-known Nerode equivalence for finite words plays a fundamental role in our understanding of the class of regular languages. The equivalence leads to the Myhill-Nerode theorem and a canonical automaton, which in turn, is the basis of several automata learning algorithms. A Nerode-like equivalence has been studied for various classes of timed languages. In this work, we focus on timed automata with integer resets.</p></br>

											<p>This class is known to have good automata-theoretic properties and is also useful for practical modeling. Our main contribution is a Nerode-style equivalence for this class that depends on a constant K. We show that the equivalence leads to a Myhill-Nerode theorem and a canonical one-clock integer-reset timed automaton with maximum constant K. Based on the canonical form, we develop an Angluin-style active learning algorithm whose query complexity is polynomial in the size of the canonical form.</p></br>
